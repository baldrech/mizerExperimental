\description{
Takes a MizerParams object \code{params} with arbitrary density dependence and
returns a MizerParams object with Beverton-Holt density-dependence. There is
a one-parameter family of Beverton-Holt reproduction curves that have the
property that, for the initial size spectrum for each species, the energy
invested into reproduction leads to the reproduction rate that is required to
maintain the given egg abundance. By specifying one of the parameters
\code{erepro}, \code{R_max} or \code{reproduction_level} you pick the desired reproduction
curve. More details of these parameters are provided below.

\details{
With Beverton-Holt density dependence the relation between the energy
invested into reproduction and the number of eggs hatched is determined
by two parameters: the reproductive efficiency \code{erepro} and the maximum
reproduction rate \code{R_max}.

If no maximum is imposed on the reproduction rate
(\eqn{R_{max} = \infty}{R_max = Inf}) then the resulting density-independent
reproduction rate \eqn{R_{di}}{R_di} is proportional
to the total rate \eqn{E_R} at which energy is invested into reproduction,
\deqn{R_{di} = \frac{\text{erepro}}{2 w_{min}} E_R,}{R_di = (erepro/(2 w_min)) E_R,}
where the proportionality factor is given by the reproductive efficiency
\code{erepro} divided by the egg size \code{w_min} to convert energy to egg number and
by a factor of 2 to account for the two sexes.

Imposing a finite maximum reproduction rate \eqn{R_{max}}{R_max} leads to a
non-linear relationship between energy invested and eggs hatchted. This
density-dependent reproduction rate \eqn{R_{dd}}{R_dd} is given as
\deqn{R_{dd} = R_{di}
\frac{R_{max}}{R_{di} + R_{max}}.}{R_dd = R_di R_max/(R_di + R_max).}

(All quantities in the above equations are species-specific but we dropped
the species index for simplicity.)

The following plot illustrates the Beverton-Holt density dependence in the
reproduction rate for two different choices of parameters.
\figure{Beverton-Holt-plot-1.png}

This plot shows that a given energy \eqn{E_R} invested into reproduction can
lead to the same reproduction rate \eqn{R_{dd}}{R_dd} with different choices
of the parameters \code{R_max} and \code{erepro}. A higher \code{R_max} coupled with a lower
\code{erepro} can give the same value as a lower \code{R_max} coupled with a higher
\code{erepro}.

We denote the ratio between the density-dependent reproduction rate
\eqn{R_{dd}}{R_dd} and the maximal reproduction rate  \eqn{R_{max}}{R_max}
the \code{reproduction_level}.

For the given initial state in the MizerParams object \code{params} one can
calculate the energy \eqn{E_R} that is invested into reproduction by the
mature individuals. One can also calculate the reproduction rate
\eqn{R_{dd}}{R_dd} that is required to keep the egg abundance constant. This
determines the location of the black dot in the above graph. You then only
need one parameter to select one from the family of Beverton-Holt
curves going through that point. This parameter can be \code{erepro}, \code{R_max} or
the \code{reproduction_level}.

The parameter you provide can be either a vector, with one value for each
species, or a single value that is then used for all species. The
values for \code{R_max} must be larger than \eqn{R_{dd}}{R_dd} and can range
up to \code{Inf}. The values for the \code{reproduction_level} must be positive and
less than 1. The values for \code{erepro} must be large enough to allow the
required reproducion rate. They should also be smaller than 1 to be
physiologically sensible, but this is not enforced by the function.

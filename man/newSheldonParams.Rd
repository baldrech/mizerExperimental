\arguments{
\item{w_inf}{Asymptotic size of species}

\item{w_min}{Egg size of species}

\item{eta}{Ratio between maturity size \code{w_mat} and asymptotic size
\code{w_inf}. Default is 10^(-0.6), approximately 1/4.. Ignored if
\code{w_mat} is supplied explicitly.}

\item{w_mat}{Maturity size of species. Default value is
\code{eta * w_inf}.}

\item{no_w}{The number of size bins in the community spectrum. These bins
will be equally spaced on a logarithmic scale. Default value is such that
there are 50 bins for each factor of 10 in weight.}

\item{n}{Scaling exponent of the maximum intake rate.}

\item{p}{Scaling exponent of the standard metabolic rate. By default this is
equal to the exponent \code{n}.}

\item{lambda}{Exponent of the abundance power law.}

\item{kappa}{Coefficient in abundance power law.}

\item{alpha}{The assimilation efficiency of the community.}

\item{ks}{Standard metabolism coefficient.}

\item{k_vb}{The vonBertalanffy growth parameter.}

\item{beta}{Preferred predator prey mass ratio.}

\item{sigma}{Width of prey size preference.}

\item{f0}{Expected average feeding level. Used to set \code{gamma}, the
coefficient in the search rate. Ignored if \code{gamma} is given
explicitly.}

\item{gamma}{Volumetric search rate. If not provided, default is determined
by \code{\link{get_gamma_default}} using the value of \code{f0}.}

\item{ext_mort_prop}{The proportion of the total mortality that comes from
external mortality, i.e., from sources not explicitly modelled. A number in
the interval [0, 1).}

\item{R_factor}{The factor such that \code{R_max = R_factor * R}, where \code{R_max}
is the maximum recruitment allowed and \code{R} is the steady-state
recruitment. Thus the larger \code{R_factor} the less the impact of the
non-linear stock-recruitment curve.}

This functions creates a \code{MizerParams} object with a single
species. This species is embedded in a fixed power-law community spectrum
\deqn{N_c(w) = \kappa w^{-\lambda}}
This community provides the food income for the species. Cannibalism is
switched off. The predation mortality arises only from the predators in the
power-law community and it is assumed that the predators in the community
have the same feeding parameters as the foreground species. The function has
many arguments, all of which have default values.
}
\details{
In addition to setting up the parameters, this function also sets up an
initial condition that is close to steady state, under the assumption of
no fishing.

Although the steady state is often stable without imposing a stock
recruitment relationship, the function can set a Beverton-Holt type stock
recruitment relationship that imposes a maximal reproduction rate that is a
multiple of the recruitment rate at steady state. That multiple is set by the
argument \code{R_factor}.

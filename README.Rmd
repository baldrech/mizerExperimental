# mizerExperimental

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This is an extension package for the mizer package (<https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/>) that contains additional features contributed by the mizer community. These features can then be further improved while being used by the community. Once matured, frequently-used features can be moved to the core mizer package.

If you have code for working with mizer that you feel might be useful to other mizer users, please describe it in [a new issue on the issue tracker](https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizerExperimental/issues/new) and we'll comment on how it can be included in this package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of mizerExperimental from GitHub with

``` r
remotes::install_github("sizespectrum/mizerExperimental")
```

If this gives an error saying "there is no package called `remotes`" then you also need to do

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
```

before trying again to install `mizerExperimental`.

You may be prompted to update some of your existing packages. The one package that you should always update is the `mizer` package, because the `mizerExperimental` package will always be designed to work with the most recent released version of mizer.

Should you get an error message saying something like: "Error: Failed to install `mizerExperimental` from GitHub: (converted from warning) ..." Then you could try

``` r
Sys.setenv("R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS" = "true")
remotes::install_github("sizespectrum/mizerExperimental")
```

This is discussed at <https://github.com/r-lib/remotes/issues/403>

## Features

-   Functions and a shiny app for interactively tuning parameters, started with `tuneParams()`.

-   `getYieldVsF()` and `plotYieldVsF()` for calculating and plotting yield curve.

-   Animated plot of mizer simulation with `animateSpectra()`

-   Showing two plots side-by-side with the same axes and the same legend. This is made possible for some of the plots via the `displayFrames()` function.

-   New wrapper function `newSheldonParams()` that sets up a single species in a power-law background.
